AWS - GoLang 
==============================================================================

# Description :
Will list all my GoLang script/programs in this repo. 
Hope they will hope you on this fields.
Enjoy !

# Install go for your system
Please check [https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install)

# Install awscli
You should find information here [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fr_fr/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/fr_fr/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)
Install awscli is convenient because it will be helpful to verify your code on your AWS assets.
It will also help to configure your environment ('aws configure') to avoid Keys saved within the program (which is bad !!)

# Install AWS SDK for Go
go get -u github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/...

# Build the executable
go build {program}.go
